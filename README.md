This repository contains your original static site and a new React upgrade scaffold (Vite + React).

Quick start:

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Notes:

- Your original static files are in the `backup/` folder.
- The React app source is in `src/` and uses the existing `assets/` folder for images.
- Theme toggle is available in the header; it toggles a simple light/dark theme via CSS variables.

If you want, I can run `npm install` and start the dev server, or refine the theming and animations further.
